     <h2>Summary</h2>
     Our biggest obstacle was probably lack of time which
     could have been avoided had we begun earlier. We also split the coding
     of the server and the client into two pairs expecting that the work load
     would have been the same. In hindsight the server required significantly
     less code and it we should probably have begunw with both pairs coding
     the client.

     Logging into the camera server also ended up taking a significant amount
     of time and which could've been avoided if we were given ssh keys instead.
     Having a login per group would have also been great to avoid several
     server issues, e.g. several groups using the same program name.
   </p>

     We also accidentally pushed eclipse files to the git repo which had to be
     manually removed and in the end we abandoned the repo all together, could
     have been avoided if we had included the right eclipse files in our
     .gitignore file.
