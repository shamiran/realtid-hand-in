     <h2>Summary</h2>
     Our biggest obstacle was probably lack of time which
     could have been avoided had we begun earlier. We also split the coding
     of the server and the client into two pairs expecting that the work load
     would have been the same. In hindsight the server required significantly
     less code and it we should probably have begunw with both pairs coding
     the client
   </p>

     We also accidentally pushed eclipse files to the git repo which had to be
     manually removed and in the end we abandoned the repo all together, could
     have been avoided if we had included the right eclipse files in our
     .gitignore file.
